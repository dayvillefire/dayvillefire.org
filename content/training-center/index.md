This training center was built in 2014 by the Dayville Fire District to address the pressing issue that the firefighters of the Dayville Fire Company and surrounding towns did not have a place where they can go for quality and safe training any time of the year. The members of the Fire District and the Fire Company spent well over two years of planning to make this possible. The building was constructed off-site in Illinois by American Fire Training Systems and then put together at its address of 530 Litchfield Ave in Killingly CT. The building is constructed at of shipping containers that are then customized to be fire training centers. The **Dennis R. Lemery Training Center** sits on about 5 acres of land, is over 4000 square feet and has a large list of training aids to help firefighters be better prepared for emergencies. Some of the training props consist of a confidence maze, two Class A live fire burn rooms, a roof ventilation prop, forcible entry door, and movable walls -- just to name a few.

The **Dennis R. Lemery Training Center** was named after Lieutenant Dennis R. Lemery of the Dayville Fire Company to remember the sacrifice given by him. Lt. Lemery was an 18 year veteran of the Dayville Fire Company and the lieutenant of the Ladder Company. He was a very active member with the company as well as with the community where he was involved with the cub scouts, boy scouts and local baseball teams. On the fateful day of January 19, 1994 at the young age of 36, after responding to several calls, Lt. Lemery lost his life after suffering a heart attack when he returned home. Lt. Lemery was an outstanding firefighter as well as a father, husband, and community member. His sacrifice and memory will never be forgotten here at the Dayville Fire Company. May Lt. Lemery always rest in peace.
