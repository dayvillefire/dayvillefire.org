    subtitle = "The Dayville Fire Company is a combination fire company that protects the village of Dayville from medical, fire, hazardous material and environmental emergencies. The Dayville Fire Company was established in 1937 to protect the ever-growing village of Dayville but the roots of fire protection in Dayville can be traced back to the mid to late 1800s when the fire protection for the local mills would also respond to fires in the village.<br/><br/>The Dayville Fire Company covers an area that is about 9 square miles in size and is one of the most diverse and busiest fire districts not only in the Town of Killingly but also in all of Windham County. Dayville is the center of the Town of Killingly and covers the main intersection Rt. 12 and Rt. 101, which is the location of many commercial buildings and shopping plazas. We also cover the Towns Industrial park that houses several large warehouses, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities. Some of these include the fifth largest Frito Lay plant in North America, which are also the townâ€™s largest employer and a three-turbine natural gas power plant. We also protect Quinebaug Valley Community College, the Killingly elementary and middle schools, an alternative high school, and several other preschools and daycares. Along with all that we cover about 6 miles of Interstate 395, have multiple large elderly housing complexes and a large residential base."
